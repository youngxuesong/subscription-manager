  - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot token, obtained from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).

### 3. Set up the Webhook

- Run the following command in your terminal, replacing `<YOUR_WORKER_URL>` and `<YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN>` with your actual values:

```bash
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=<YOUR_WORKER_URL>"
```

### 4. (Optional) Configure Cron Trigger

- To enable daily reminders, go to your Worker's settings.
- Under "Triggers", add a Cron Trigger with the schedule `0 8 * * *` to run the check every day at 8 AM.
